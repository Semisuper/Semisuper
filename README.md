- 👋 Hi, I’m @Semisuper
- 👀 I’m interested in telling stories through interactive experiences, mostly horror/thriller, mystery, sci-fi, the works.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript, python, scratch, and a dash of godot
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything, I have decent art skills, can work in python and scratch, and can pick up on anything new pretty well.
- 📫 You can reach me at my email jlathrom84@gmail.com, or my discord (joebob._.) I also goof around on my scratch frequently, my username is semisupervised.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently stressing over how I'm going to excecute the telling of my own narritive, known as division 8. I've been writing it in some form or another for the past 6 years at least.
